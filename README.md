# Image Processing Workspace

This workspace contains solutions to programming assignments for the courses CSL506_IVP_S24 and CSL442_IVP. The solutions are divided into two main directories: `IPU_1` and `IPU_2`.

## Directory Structure

- `IPU_1`: Contains solutions to the Programming Assignment-1 on course CSL442_IVP. Each question is solved in a separate Python file. More details can be found in the [README_1.md](IPU_1/README_1.md) file in this directory.

- `IPU_2`: Contains solutions to the Programming Assignment-2 on course CSL506_IVP_S24. Each question is solved in a separate Python file. More details can be found in the [README_2.md](IPU_2/README_2.md) file in this directory.

## Running the Code

To run any solution, navigate to the file and run the Python script. Make sure you have the necessary images or video clips in the same directory as the Python script.
